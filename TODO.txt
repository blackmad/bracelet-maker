MONDRIAN: if you're at the top or bottom ...



- implement straight cuff
- see if I can map straight cuff to conic cuff
- notice how explode doesn't connect to the edges
- make a box lattice generator
- posture collar


- get collar outline working
- get last of designs reimported

- make circles a little more linear + better in general
- experiment with veras-x-circle being outline
- save variables when only changing outer design

- implement tilings
- implement hinged tessels
- what about a chinese lattice generator
