- bring back conic cuff
- fix so you can actually change design
- rewrite sizing info
- fix outline
- generally clean up outline
- see if smooth() can be used in voronoi
- make circles extend to outside

fixes:
explode is ugly now
implement boundaryDilation in fast-abstract-inner-design
fix gap on this one https://127.0.0.1:4501/static/#StraightCuffOuter.debug=false&StraightCuffOuter.height=2&StraightCuffOuter.wristCircumference=7&StraightCuffOuter.safeBorderWidth=0.25&StraightCuffOuter.forearmCircumference=7.4&InnerDesignCirclePacking.debug=false&InnerDesignCirclePacking.seed=1&InnerDesignCirclePacking.borderSize=0.13&InnerDesignCirclePacking.minCircleSize=0.02&InnerDesignCirclePacking.maxCircleSize=0.33&InnerDesignCirclePacking.numLines=9&InnerDesignCirclePacking.constrainCircles=false&InnerDesignCirclePacking.forceContainment=false&InnerDesignCirclePacking.outlineSize=0.1&InnerDesignCirclePacking.boundaryDilation=0.22&InnerDesignCirclePacking.smoothOutline=false
vera-x-circles - simplify it, kill the parts that are ugly
circles without containment don't connect to sides

features:
bring back collar outline
why aren't all settings being saved in UI?



future:
- see if I can map straight cuff to conic cuff
- notice how explode doesn't connect to the edges
- make a box lattice generator
- posture collar

- make circles a little more linear + better in general
- experiment with veras-x-circle being outline
- save variables when only changing outer design

- implement tilings
- implement hinged tessels
- what about a chinese lattice generator
