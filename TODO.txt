- why does voronoi not mirrored cause visible linebreaks

- DEBUG - not persisting on reload? - kaleido is always so weird
- DEBUG - clear debug on reload / make toggling work

- snowflakes don't allows paths to touch two lines 
- try snowflakes again with random paths???

- finally figure out grouping params / conditional params
- look into posture collar

oh this is a smart way to fuck with voronois - https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EOWHM9oW4AAI1Wc?format=jpg&name=large

- ellipses / different sized circles in circle packing
- clean up hashmarks.ts now
- add grouping of params and/or hiding of params (curves in hashmarks, outline elsewhere)
- make a mode that uses clipper.js to explode a bunch of shapes.

- spiral? https://github.com/marcosfparreiras/html5-canvas-archimedean-spiral-polygon

- why is wide wrist in design params
- add outline to conic cuff
- document in UI when negative outline is possible

bugs:
- make lines go to edges
- "sizing" heading still sometimes off
- information on index page
- index page consistent box height

- make circles extend to outside
- rewrite sizing info

- why is this fine https://127.0.0.1:4501/static/index.html#StraightCuffOuter.debug=false&StraightCuffOuter.height=2&StraightCuffOuter.wristCircumference=7&StraightCuffOuter.safeBorderWidth=0.25&StraightCuffOuter.forearmCircumference=7.4&InnerDesignVera.debug=false&InnerDesignVera.seed=1&InnerDesignVera.shapeName=Pentagon&InnerDesignVera.shapeSize1=0.3&InnerDesignVera.shapeSize2=0.2&InnerDesignVera.bufferWidth=0.27&InnerDesignVera.xNoiseCoefficient=0.01&InnerDesignVera.yNoiseCoefficient=0.01&InnerDesignVera.xScaleNoiseCoefficient=0.01&InnerDesignVera.yScaleNoiseCoefficient=0.01&InnerDesignVera.minScale=0.5&InnerDesignVera.maxScale=1.25&InnerDesignVera.constrainShapes=false&InnerDesignVera.forceContainment=true&InnerDesignVera.outlineSize=0.1&InnerDesignVera.smoothOutline=false but 0.28 border broken??


fixes:
explode is ugly now
implement boundaryDilation in fast-abstract-inner-design
fix gap on this one https://127.0.0.1:4501/static/#StraightCuffOuter.debug=false&StraightCuffOuter.height=2&StraightCuffOuter.wristCircumference=7&StraightCuffOuter.safeBorderWidth=0.25&StraightCuffOuter.forearmCircumference=7.4&InnerDesignCirclePacking.debug=false&InnerDesignCirclePacking.seed=1&InnerDesignCirclePacking.borderSize=0.13&InnerDesignCirclePacking.minCircleSize=0.02&InnerDesignCirclePacking.maxCircleSize=0.33&InnerDesignCirclePacking.numLines=9&InnerDesignCirclePacking.constrainCircles=false&InnerDesignCirclePacking.forceContainment=false&InnerDesignCirclePacking.outlineSize=0.1&InnerDesignCirclePacking.boundaryDilation=0.22&InnerDesignCirclePacking.smoothOutline=false
vera-x-circles - simplify it, kill the parts that are ugly
circles without containment don't connect to sides

features:
bring back collar outline
why aren't all settings being saved in UI?



future:
- see if I can map straight cuff to conic cuff
- notice how explode doesn't connect to the edges
- make a box lattice generator
- posture collar

- make circles a little more linear + better in general
- experiment with veras-x-circle being outline
- save variables when only changing outer design

- implement tilings
- implement hinged tessels
- what about a chinese lattice generator
