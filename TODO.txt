features:
add rivet holes to straight cuff
bring back collar outline
make SVG export correct with inches/scale
bring back PDF export
why aren't all settings being saved in UI?

fixes:
hexes is ugly now
lines is ugly now
explode is ugly now
implement boundaryDilation in fast-abstract-inner-design
fix gap on this one https://127.0.0.1:4501/static/#StraightCuffOuter.debug=false&StraightCuffOuter.height=2&StraightCuffOuter.wristCircumference=7&StraightCuffOuter.safeBorderWidth=0.25&StraightCuffOuter.forearmCircumference=7.4&InnerDesignCirclePacking.debug=false&InnerDesignCirclePacking.seed=1&InnerDesignCirclePacking.borderSize=0.13&InnerDesignCirclePacking.minCircleSize=0.02&InnerDesignCirclePacking.maxCircleSize=0.33&InnerDesignCirclePacking.numLines=9&InnerDesignCirclePacking.constrainCircles=false&InnerDesignCirclePacking.forceContainment=false&InnerDesignCirclePacking.outlineSize=0.1&InnerDesignCirclePacking.boundaryDilation=0.22&InnerDesignCirclePacking.smoothOutline=false
hexes: should technically take into account unused space and center it
hexes: should technically not break out of box
vera-x-circles - simplify it, kill the parts that are ugly

future:
- see if I can map straight cuff to conic cuff
- notice how explode doesn't connect to the edges
- make a box lattice generator
- posture collar

- make circles a little more linear + better in general
- experiment with veras-x-circle being outline
- save variables when only changing outer design

- implement tilings
- implement hinged tessels
- what about a chinese lattice generator
